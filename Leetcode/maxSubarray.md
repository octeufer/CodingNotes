# Maximum Subarray

Given an array nums, find the contiguous subarray which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## Example:
    `Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
     Output: 6
     Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.`

## Solution:

- Divide and Conquer
    + split the problem into subproblems and solve them recursively.
    + O(N*logN).
- Greedy
- Dynamic Programming
